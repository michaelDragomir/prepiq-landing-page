				<h2>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
				<h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
				<p>
					To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
					controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute"
					and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us
					(individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties
					agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
					expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before
					initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
					written notice from one Party to the other Party.
				</p>

				<h3>Restrictions</h3>
				<p>
					The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
					between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
					(a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
					there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
					class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c)
					there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
					purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
					any other persons.
				</p>

				<h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>
				<p>
					The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
					above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
						validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party;
					</li>
					<li>
						any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
						piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and
					</li>
					<li>any claim for injunctive relief.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then
					neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
					portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
					such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction
					within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree
					to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
