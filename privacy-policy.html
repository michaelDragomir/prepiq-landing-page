				<p>
					<span class="highlight">In Short:</span> If you choose to register or
					log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have
					access to certain information about you.
				</p>

				<p>
					Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
					third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
					logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
					information about you from your social media provider. The profile
					information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
					concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
					list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
					make public on such a social media platform.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
					described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to
					you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and
					are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by
					your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review
					their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share
					your personal information, and how you can set your privacy

				<p>
					<span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We keep your information for

				</p>

				<p>
					We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
					necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
					longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
					accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice
					will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
					period of time in which users have an account with us.
				</p>

				<p>
					When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
					personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
					information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
					personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
					securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
					further processing until deletion is possible.

				<h2>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight">In Short:</span> We aim to protect your
					personal information through a system of organizational and technical
					security measures.
				</p>

				<p>
					We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
					organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
					any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
					and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
					over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed
					to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
					cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
					to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
					modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
					personal information, transmission of personal information to and from
					our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services

				<p>
					We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children

					information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
					least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
					consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn
					that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
					been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
					measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become

				<p>
					<strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
					consent to process your personal information, which may be express

					right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your

				<h2>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
				<p>
					Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
					applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
					activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
					online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
					uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
					signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
					DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
					communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
					online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
					inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
					Notice.
				</p>

				<p>
					California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web
					browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or
					legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not
					respond to them at this time.
